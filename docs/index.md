# Byzantine Protocol
Shape Reality. Choose Your Power. Define Tomorrow.

A card RPG of technological advancement, cultural power, and reality-shaping ambition in an alternate 2088 where the Byzantine Empire never fell.

In 2088, three ancient powers compete not through warfare, but through technological supremacy, cultural dominance, and the race for space. As quantum computing warps reality, living cities grow toward the stars, and humanity's consciousness expands beyond its limits, you'll navigate a world where the future and past collide. Choose your path:

* Master reality-bending quantum technology with the [New Roman Empire](new-roman-empire.md).
* Shape evolution and living cities with the [Frankish Union](frankish-union.md)
* Pioneer space and robotics with the [Hanseatic League]
* Or forge your own destiny in the independent zones
