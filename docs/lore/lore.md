# Historical Divergence Point
The key divergence occurs in 1204 CE during the Fourth Crusade. Instead of the crusaders sacking Constantinople, Emperor Alexios III Angelos successfully negotiates with Venice and the crusaders, offering them trading privileges and military support for their campaign in Egypt. This prevents the devastating blow to Byzantine power that historically fragmented the empire.

## Immediate Historical Consequences

- The Byzantine Empire maintains control of Asia Minor and the Balkans
- The Venetian-Byzantine alliance creates a powerful Mediterranean trading network
- The Empire adopts early banking innovations from Italian city-states
- Strong Byzantine influence prevents the Ottoman Empire from gaining significant power in Anatolia
