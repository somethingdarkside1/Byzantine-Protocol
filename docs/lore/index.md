# 2.1 World Overview

In the waning years of the 12th century, the Byzantine Empire stood at a crossroads. Emperor Isaac II Angelos, through a combination of court intrigue and calculated reforms, maintained his grip on power where history might have seen him fall. The Fourth Crusade, proceeding to its intended destination of Egypt rather than being diverted to Constantinople, preserved the empire's wealth and scholarly traditions at a crucial moment in history.

In the Byzantine court, a subtle transformation began. Greek scholars, protected by imperial patronage, merged ancient atomic theory with new mathematical principles from Italian banking innovations. The court's traditional theological debates gradually gave way to discussions of natural philosophy, though always carefully framed within Orthodox Christian doctrine to maintain political stability.

As the 13th century progressed, three distinct powers emerged in Europe. The Byzantine Empire, maintaining its control of the Mediterranean trade routes, evolved into what would become the New Roman Empire. Their bureaucrats, already skilled in the intricacies of administration, began developing computational devices based on preserved Greek mathematical principles.

In Western Europe, a series of successful marriage alliances between the French and British royal houses achieved what centuries of warfare could not. The resulting Frankish Union turned its attention to biological sciences and environmental mastery, perhaps influenced by the harsh experiences of the Great Famine and Black Death.

The German trading cities of the north, feeling pressure from these consolidated powers, transformed the loose Hanseatic League into a true federation. Their merchants, long accustomed to watching the stars for navigation, became patrons of astronomical research and early theories of space travel.
The tensions between these powers might have led to devastating wars, but instead produced the Byzantine Protocol of 1850. This agreement, negotiated in the grand halls of Constantinople, established the framework for competition through technological achievement rather than military might. The Protocol delineated clear spheres of influence, mandated technology sharing for crisis response, and established the first international environmental protection measures.

This tripartite division of power shaped the development of science and society in ways that would have seemed impossible in earlier centuries. The New Roman Empire pursued the manipulation of reality itself through quantum computation, the Frankish Union developed living cities that grew like organisms, and the Hanseatic League reached for the stars with increasingly sophisticated space technology.

By 2088, these three powers had transformed the world through their peculiar forms of progress, though the ancient dance of diplomatic intrigue and political maneuvering remained much as it had been in the days of Isaac II Angelos, nearly nine centuries earlier.

# 2.2 Alternative History
The preservation of the Byzantine Empire fundamentally altered the flow of global power. With Constantinople maintaining control of the crucial east-west trade routes, Islamic expansion took a different path. The Ottoman Empire never formed, leading to a more fragmented but culturally dynamic Middle East. Persian influence remained strong in Central Asia, while Arab scholars continued their scientific traditions, often collaborating with Byzantine academics in fields ranging from mathematics to astronomy.

This global order, was far from static. Complex webs of alliances, technological dependencies, and trade relationships created a sophisticated diplomatic dance. The major powers engaged in constant technological and cultural competition, while smaller states maintained independence through specialized technological expertise and careful diplomatic balancing.

The [[Byzantine Protocol]]'s principles of non-military competition and mandatory cooperation for crisis response created a world where advancement occurred through innovation rather than conquest. By 2088, this complex web of relationships had created a world that still grappled with fundamental questions of human nature, power, and progress.

### Combine
In the Far East, Japan's isolation ended differently. Without Western military pressure, the country chose technological integration over military modernization after observing the successes of the European powers' scientific competition. By the late 1900s, Japan had pioneered neural network technology, leading to the formation of the Pacific Confederation. This fourth major power unified much of the Pacific Rim through shared technological benefits rather than military conquest, creating a unique form of technological unity that included Korea and much of coastal Asia.

### India
The Indian subcontinent, benefiting from continued Byzantine influence and early adoption of quantum computing principles, maintained independence through technological advancement. The [[Indian Sangha]] emerged as a significant independent power, developing a unique synthesis of quantum mysticism and spiritual practices that made them valuable trading partners to all major powers while remaining firmly autonomous.

### China
China, rather than experiencing revolution, underwent a gradual transformation. The imperial system evolved into a technological meritocracy, closely aligned with but distinct from PacNeuro. Their focus on atmospheric engineering and weather control made them indispensable to global environmental management, ensuring their independence while maintaining profitable relationships with all major powers.

### California
The Americas developed as a patchwork of independent states, each aligning with different major powers while maintaining autonomy. California emerged as a semi-independent technology hub, its Quantum Valley evolving into a quantum computing research center that rivaled the New Roman Empire's capabilities. This arrangement suited the major powers, as it provided a neutral ground for technological exchange.

### African Union
The African Alliance emerged as a loose confederation of states, each specializing in different technological domains while maintaining a unified diplomatic front in dealings with the major powers.

### Middle East
The Middle East, while politically fragmented, became a crucial neutral zone for technological exchange. The Byzantine influence led to the preservation of ancient cities, universities, and learning centers, which evolved into modern research institutions. The region's oil wealth was gradually transformed into renewable energy innovation, making them key players in global energy politics.

### Ukraine
Perhaps most intriguingly, Ukraine evolved into a unique neutral zone between the three European powers. The Ukrainian Technology Exchange Zone became the primary location for technological transfer and diplomatic negotiations between the powers, its neutrality guaranteed by all three major states and its prosperity ensured by its role as an innovation hub.

# 2.3 Power Structure

The [[Byzantine Protocol]] and its related pacts created a sophisticated system of checks and balances. Each power maintained clear territorial control while exerting influence through technological and cultural means rather than military force.

The game mechanics reflect this through three primary resources: Technology Points (TP), Culture Points (CP), and Space Points (SP), each representing different forms of influence and advancement.

[[New Roman Empire]] controls:
* Greece and Balkans
* Turkey and Anatolia
* Southern Italy
* Parts of North Africa
* Eastern Mediterranean
* Black Sea Region

The [[Frankish Union]] controls:

* Britain
* France
* Spain
* Portugal
* Benelux Region
* Western Mediterranean

Their bio-engineering and environmental control capabilities are reflected through Evolution and Living Architecture cards. Their proxy states in North Africa serve as biological research zones, represented by special Cultural Movement cards.

[[Hanseatic League]] controls:

* Germany
* Poland
* Scandinavia
* Baltic States
* Northern Russia
* Central Europe

Their space technology focus manifests through Orbital Infrastructure cards and Space Development mechanics. Buffer zones like Ukraine serve as technology exchange points, represented by special Trade Node cards.

Each major power can attempt to influence these zones, but excessive control by any one power triggers automatic balancing mechanisms through Crisis Event cards, forcing diplomatic solutions.

### Competition Mechanics

# 2.4 Technological State

**Current State (2088)**
The quantum computing revolution has transformed computation and networking. While true reality manipulation remains theoretical, quantum systems enable advanced probability calculation and limited quantum entanglement communication. Most citizens interact with quantum-enhanced devices for secure communications, predictive modeling, and data processing.

Biological engineering has progressed from genetic modification to creating basic self-repairing materials and primitive living structures. While fully autonomous living cities remain theoretical, bio-engineered materials that can heal minor damage and adapt to environmental conditions are becoming common in high-end construction.

In space, humanity maintains a growing orbital presence. The first space elevator is under construction, though completion remains years away. Regular orbital flights serve research stations and early manufacturing facilities. Mars missions are in the planning stages, while asteroid mining operations are just beginning.

Neural interface technology, pioneered in the 2060s, enables direct brain-computer connections. By 2070, the first successful consciousness transfers to quantum networks were achieved, though with strict time limitations. Current neural tech focuses on enhanced information processing, memory augmentation, and basic digital consciousness experiments.
