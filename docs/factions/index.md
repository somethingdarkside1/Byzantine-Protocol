## Major Powers
### New Roman Empire
Direct successor to the Byzantine Empire. specializes in quantum computation and manipulation. Maintains centralized bureaucratic control through centralized computational systems. Controls Mediterranean trade routes and holds quantum computing supremacy. 

Capital at Constantinople houses the largest quantum research facilities on Earth. Primary developer of reality engineering protocols and probability manipulation systems.

> "Reality is not what we observe, but what we calculate it to be. In this, we find both divine truth and quantum certainty."
>
> Oracle-Empress Sofia Paleologos, 2060

### Frankish Union
Formed through Anglo-French unification in 1235, pioneered biological engineering during Black Death response. Developed first successful living architecture systems in 1950s. Controls Western European territory through bio-organic infrastructure network centered on Paris-London Metroplex. Leads global environmental control research and species-development protocols. Maintains significant research territories in North Africa and Arctic regions.

> "Evolution is not a force we must endure, but an art we shall perfect."
>
> Queen Eleanor IV, 2010

### Hanseatic League
Evolved from medieval trade confederation into space-industrial power. Operates Earth's primary space elevator network from Hamburg Orbital. Controls majority of orbital manufacturing and zero-gravity production facilities. Maintains automated workforce exceeding 70% of total industrial capacity. Dominates orbital resource extraction and space-based manufacturing alongside Bharatiya Ganarajya.

> "The void between stars is humanity's greatest marketplace."
> 
> Star-Admiral Helena von Reichtum, 2088

#### Pacific Neural Confederation
A technological confederation built on East Asia's historical maritime trade networks. Emerged from Asia's neural technology focus after 1950, integrating the Yangtze Delta through technological and economic ties. Regional autonomy is ultimate, with Beijing, Hong-Kong, and Shanghai operating independently. 

> "In the network of minds, we transcend the boundaries of self."
> 
> Akiko, 2040

#### Bharatiya Ganarajya
Bharatiya Ganarajya, or Bharatiya Republic, evolved from India's scientific institutions gaining direct administrative control during the neural computing revolution. Power flows from the Technical Directorate in Delhi, composed of senior scientists from the research establishments. Mumbai houses financial operations, Bangalore leads neural interface development, and Hyderabad specializes in biotechnology synthesis. Kerala is one of the few locations outside the Hanseatic League that contains. 

Administrative authority derives from scientific achievement, with advancement determined by research contributions and technical expertise. Developed unique quantum computation methods independent of Western approaches. 

> "Knowledge administers; wisdom governs."
>
> Director Priya Varma, Technical Directorate, 1645

#### Independent Powers
Achemen, Pacifica
Maintained independence through technological brokerage position. Houses primary neutral research facilities for cross-power development. Developed key integration protocols for quantum-neural-biological systems. Serves as vital technology exchange point between major powers.

> "Innovation thrives best in the spaces between empires."
> 
> Director Sarah Chen, Achemen Council, 2088

Australian Environmental Collective (EcoState)
Developed first successful climate control systems. Operates largest underwater habitat network. Controls Southern Hemisphere environmental stabilization systems. Primary developer of marine protocols. Maintains critical environmental monitoring stations across Pacific.

> "The Earth is not our inheritance, but a gift to protect."
> 
> Environmental Director James Cooper, 2088

Ukrainian Technology Exchange Zone (Ukraine)
Neutral technology transfer hub between major powers. Operates largest open research facilities. Developed standardized technology exchange protocols. Maintains critical buffer zone status through multi-power agreements. Houses primary crisis response coordination centers.

> "We are the crossroads where all paths of progress meet."
> 
> President Olena Kovlenko, 2072

Brazilian Bio-Research Confederation
Controls largest biological research territories. Operates rainforest consciousness integration network. Developed key environmental adaptation technologies. Maintains significant biological computing facilities. Primary developer of organic computing systems outside Frankish Union.

> "In the symphony of life, we are learning to conduct."
> 
> Bio-Director Maria Santos, 2088

Arctic Research Consortium
International research zone established after polar melt. Controls critical climate stabilization systems. Operates primary resource management protocols. Maintains neutral status through multi-power treaties.

> "In this transformed land, we forge the tools of planetary survival."
> 
> Chief Researcher Erik Larsson, 2028
