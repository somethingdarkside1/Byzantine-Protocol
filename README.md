# Byzantine Protocol
A card RPG of technological advancement, cultural power, and reality-shaping ambition in an alternate 2088 where the Byzantine Empire never fell.

## BYZANTINE PROTOCOL
### Shape Reality. Choose Your Power. Define Tomorrow.

In 2088, three ancient powers compete not through warfare, but through technological supremacy, cultural dominance, and the race for space. As quantum computing warps reality, living cities grow toward the stars, and humanity's consciousness expands beyond its limits, you'll navigate a world where the future and past collide.
Choose your path:

- Master reality-bending quantum technology with the New Roman Empire
- Shape evolution and living cities with the Frankish Union
- Pioneer space and robotics with the Hanseatic League
- Or forge your own destiny in the independent zones

## In this alternate history cyberpunk RPG, you'll:

- Leverage experimental technology
- Build living cities and orbital colonies
- Navigate complex political intrigue
- Race to unlock humanity's next breakthrough

The future isn't decided by bullets and bombs, but by brilliant innovations, cultural influence, and the drive to push humanity's boundaries. In a world where ancient empires never fell but instead evolved, your choices will shape not just who wins, but what humanity becomes.
